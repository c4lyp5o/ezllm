# Changelog

Notable changes, reverse-chronological. Milestone-tagged (M1–M9); full history via `git log`.

## 2026-10-10 — M9: research schema (v8) + honest savings + TTFT + cost
- `fix(proxy)`: TTFT was timed from inside the stream copy — after headers had already
  arrived — so every row read 1–3ms. Now timed from upstream dispatch; the number finally
  means time-to-first-token, which is what caching research measures (`f48d20a`).
- `fix(compress)`: `Saved` was set before the ratio-floor check, so rejected rewrites still
  reported savings (prod week: 18.2k real vs 21.4k notional in one SUM). `Saved` is now 0 on
  any skip; `SavedNotional` carries the rejected potential (`19b743d`).
- `feat(store)` schema v8: request-shape capture (`prefix_sha` of system+tools+history-minus-
  newest-turn, `msg_count`, `tool_count`, `session_id` via `X-Ezllm-Session`, `req_bytes`) —
  the cacheability data `raw_usage` could never reconstruct; `compression_saved_notional`;
  versioned `model_prices` (account×model×date) with cost DERIVED at query time, unpriced
  calls counted not zeroed (`393460b`).
- `feat(server)`: capture runs on the inference path after compression (a history rewrite
  measures as the cache break it is); admin API `GET /admin/prices`,
  `PUT/DELETE /admin/accounts/{id}/prices`, `GET /admin/cost`; requests projection surfaces
  the shape columns (`0e24e32`).
- `feat(web)`: Economics cost panel (spend, priced vs unpriced, per day/account/model) +
  Providers Pricing drawer (per-account rate versions; all four rates required) (`ec27973`).

## 2026-10-09/10 — providers batch, UI cleanup pass, surface pin (deployed 2026-10-10)
- `feat(provider)`: fourth kind `gemini-openai` — Gemini's OpenAI-compat endpoint; its bad-key
  signal is `400`, honored by the auth gate only for that kind via the optional
  `AuthRejectStatuser` (`a8776ee`).
- `feat(web)`: provider presets — Command Code, DeepSeek, TokenRouter, Gemini, Groq built-in
  (`5335423`, `1d3f3d7`, `fb2a2fd`).
- `feat(registration)`: dropped all API-key **shape** checks; the probe chain is the sole
  validator, so exotic key formats are judged by the upstream (`9aa9cf1`).
- `fix(server)`: `GET /healthz` is liveness-only (`{"status":"ok"}` after a DB ping) — the
  public route no longer leaks counts, paths, or versions (`9a7b620`).
- `feat(web)`: dashboard UI cleanup pass — shared `ConfirmModal` replaces `window.confirm`
  and one-click deletes; Providers key status shown as text (`tested ok` / `test failed` /
  `untested`) not a bare dot; quota copy "quota not available"; Connect drops the Responses
  surface from the picker (server route unchanged), 2-column desktop layout; Dashboard strip
  trimmed (no ledger/dropped/schema chips, no context column); combo "custom model id" flag now
  defaults from what's actually rendered, and the profile-number pill is gone (`c099dd5`…`9915582`).
- `feat(pin)`: per-model **surface pin**, enforce-only (schema v7 `models.proto_pin`). A
  wrong-surface call to a pinned model is refused `400 pinned_surface` before any upstream
  dial; never a reroute (bodies pass through untranslated). Lookup fails closed; catalog
  resyncs preserve pins (`340442b`).
- `fix(server)`: the pin refusal reached clients as `502` while the ledger logged `400` —
  the proxy error switch had no `ErrPinned` case. Now `400 pinned_surface` with structured
  `{pinned, requested_surface}`; live-proved on prod (`03a6317`).
- `build(web)`: **rebuilt and committed `web/dist`** — the image embeds it, so source-only UI
  commits shipped the old bundle; after every UI commit, `npm run build` + commit `dist` +
  verify the served hash post-deploy (`831ecda`).
- GitHub Copilot: OAuth app registered, device flow works end-to-end, but the
  `copilot_internal/v2/token` exchange returns `403` for third-party apps → parked, not
  circumvented. OAuth artifact deleted.

## 2026-10-09 — post-ship fixes
- `fix(proxy)`: strip client `Origin` before forwarding — Anthropic reads any browser `Origin`
  as CORS and rejects with a 401; regression-tested (`8c832ef`).
- `fix(web)`: clear the dashboard session only on ezllm's own auth 401; provider 401s surface
  inline (`358cda3`).

## 2026-10-08 — Docker, dashboard polish, budget engine
- Distroless image + home-box Traefik overlay; explicit router priorities and a dedicated
  `/admin/login` limiter (`3f46f00`, `3155b76`).
- `POST /admin/chat` behind the real routing path; Chat page, Token Economics, budget controls
  (`d0f8407`, `d8d0f68`).
- Budget stage with its own context-token accounting (schema v5) (`39cbdb8`).
- Combo retry with exponential backoff before failover; `EZLLM_*` env overrides restored for
  containers; per-combo enable toggle; enabled combos advertised in `/v1/models`.
- Provider add-in-one-dialog (key validated on save) with a Claude Platform preset; lm-eval
  canary proving traffic goes through the gateway.
- MIT license.

## 2026-10-07 — compression, rules, live surface
- Compression: M5 pipeline (engines, profile CRUD, inference wiring); headroom + lite engines
  (M6.5 phase 2); caveman lossy prose condensation, gated by construction (M7).
- Rules eligibility engine — token caps + allowed-use windows; dashboard rules editor.
- Live recent-requests feed (SSE over fetch); stats explorer (granularity × range); Requests
  page with token dissection.
- Dashboard password + plaintext provider keys (explicit operator choice).

## 2026-10-06 — core: M1–M4
- M1: skeleton + health.
- M2: store + field crypto + three-surface passthrough (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`,
  `/v1/responses`), usage normalized into the SQLite ledger.
- M3: admin API + embedded dashboard; registration with capped key-test protocol sweep; live
  model-catalog probes; adapters (`opencode-go`, `openai-compatible`, `anthropic-compatible`).
- M4: combos resolve to ordered candidates + strategies; proxy attempt/commit split (failover
  that never leaks a failed hop); admin persistence (accounts, provider keys, combos, tokens).
