# Changelog

Notable changes, reverse-chronological. Milestone-tagged (M1–M7); full history via `git log`.

## 2026-10-09 — post-ship fixes
- `fix(proxy)`: strip client `Origin` before forwarding — Anthropic reads any browser `Origin`
  as CORS and rejects with a 401; regression-tested (`8c832ef`).
- `fix(web)`: clear the dashboard session only on ezllm's own auth 401; provider 401s surface
  inline (`358cda3`).

## 2026-10-08 — Docker, dashboard polish, budget engine
- Distroless image + home-box Traefik overlay; explicit router priorities and a dedicated
  `/admin/login` limiter (`3f46f00`, `3155b76`).
- `POST /admin/chat` behind the real routing path; Chat page, Token Economics, budget controls
  (`d0f8407`, `d8d0f68`).
- Budget stage with its own context-token accounting (schema v5) (`39cbdb8`).
- Combo retry with exponential backoff before failover; `EZLLM_*` env overrides restored for
  containers; per-combo enable toggle; enabled combos advertised in `/v1/models`.
- Provider add-in-one-dialog (key validated on save) with a Claude Platform preset; lm-eval
  canary proving traffic goes through the gateway.
- MIT license.

## 2026-10-07 — compression, rules, live surface
- Compression: M5 pipeline (engines, profile CRUD, inference wiring); headroom + lite engines
  (M6.5 phase 2); caveman lossy prose condensation, gated by construction (M7).
- Rules eligibility engine — token caps + allowed-use windows; dashboard rules editor.
- Live recent-requests feed (SSE over fetch); stats explorer (granularity × range); Requests
  page with token dissection.
- Dashboard password + plaintext provider keys (explicit operator choice).

## 2026-10-06 — core: M1–M4
- M1: skeleton + health.
- M2: store + field crypto + three-surface passthrough (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`,
  `/v1/responses`), usage normalized into the SQLite ledger.
- M3: admin API + embedded dashboard; registration with capped key-test protocol sweep; live
  model-catalog probes; adapters (`opencode-go`, `openai-compatible`, `anthropic-compatible`).
- M4: combos resolve to ordered candidates + strategies; proxy attempt/commit split (failover
  that never leaks a failed hop); admin persistence (accounts, provider keys, combos, tokens).
